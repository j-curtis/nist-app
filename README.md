nist-app
========

Repository for development of NIST app (see contest for more details).

## Competition Details
The details of the competition can be found [here](http://nistdata.devpost.com/).

The app is due on September 28th, 2015. The app doesn't need to be available
publicly, though it should be very close to ready for public release.
Furthermore, the app must be a "mobile app" and it must use **at least one** of
six publicly available NIST data sets, though it may also include any other
data sets in addition to the required one(s). These data sets may be found
[here](http://nistdata.devpost.com/details/data). In particular, the CODATA
data set is available [here](http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html)
for human usage and [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-codata-fundamental-physical-constants-srd-121)
in a machine readable format.

Contest rules are [here](http://nistdata.devpost.com/rules).

## Licensing
Note that, because this repository is designed to fulfill the purposes of a
competition, there is no open-source license. This is to maintain some
semblance of propriety on the work, at least until the conclusion of the
submission period for the contest.

## Design
The design of the app will be roughly modelled on a scientific calculator with
natural inclusion of NIST data constants (as well as other user defined
constants).
