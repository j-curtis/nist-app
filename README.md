# nist-app

Repository for development of NIST app (see contest for more details). 

## Competition Details

The details of the competition can be found [here](http://nistdata.devpost.com/). 

The app is due on September 28th, 2015. It doesn't need to be available publicly, though it should be very close to ready for public release. IT must be a mobile app and it must use *at least one* of six publicly available NIST data sets. These data sets may be found [here](http://nistdata.devpost.com/details/data). In particular, the CODATA data set is available [here](http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html) for human usage and [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-codata-fundamental-physical-constants-srd-121) in a machine readable format. 

Contest rules are [here](http://nistdata.devpost.com/rules).
