# nist-app

Repository for development of NIST app (see contest for more details). 

## Competition Details

The details of the competition can be found [here](http://nistdata.devpost.com/). 

The app is due on September 28th, 2015. The app doesn't need to be available publicly, though it should be very close to ready for public release. Furthermore, the app must be a "mobile app" and it must use **at least one** of six publicly available NIST data sets, though it may also include any other data sets in addition to the required one(s). These data sets may be found [here](http://nistdata.devpost.com/details/data). In particular, the CODATA data set is available [here](http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html) for human usage and [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nist-codata-fundamental-physical-constants-srd-121) in a machine readable format.
